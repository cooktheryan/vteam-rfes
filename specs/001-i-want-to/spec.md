# Feature Specification: MariaDB Operator for OpenShift

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to design an operator for mariadb deployment on to openshift using olm. We should use rhel images whenever or wherever possible"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform engineer or database administrator, I want to deploy and manage MariaDB database instances on OpenShift clusters through an automated operator that handles lifecycle management, configuration, and operational tasks, so that I can provide reliable database services to application teams without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an OpenShift cluster without MariaDB operator installed, **When** the operator is installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), **Then** the operator becomes available in the cluster and ready to manage MariaDB instances
2. **Given** the operator is installed and running, **When** a user creates a MariaDB custom resource with desired configuration, **Then** the operator provisions a MariaDB database instance matching the specified configuration
3. **Given** a running MariaDB instance managed by the operator, **When** the user updates the custom resource configuration, **Then** the operator applies the changes to the running database without data loss
4. **Given** a MariaDB instance is running, **When** the instance fails or encounters issues, **Then** the operator automatically attempts recovery and reports the status
5. **Given** a user wants to remove a MariaDB instance, **When** they delete the custom resource, **Then** the operator cleanly removes all associated resources

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the operator is upgraded while MariaDB instances are running?
- How does the system handle insufficient cluster resources for requested database instances?
- What happens if the RHEL-based container image becomes unavailable?
- How does the system handle conflicting configuration updates from multiple administrators?
- What happens during network partitions or node failures affecting database instances?
- How are backup and restore operations coordinated during operator updates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an operator that can be installed and managed through OpenShift's Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
- **FR-002**: System MUST use RHEL-based container images for all MariaDB database instances
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to declaratively specify MariaDB instance configuration through custom resources
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically provision MariaDB database instances based on custom resource specifications
- **FR-005**: System MUST continuously monitor deployed MariaDB instances and maintain desired state
- **FR-006**: System MUST support lifecycle operations including create, update, scale, and delete for MariaDB instances
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle operator upgrades without disrupting running database instances
- **FR-008**: System MUST report status and health of MariaDB instances back to users through custom resource status fields
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication and authorization model - cluster admin only, namespace-scoped, RBAC policies?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: high availability configurations - single instance only, replication, clustering, multi-master?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persistent storage requirements - storage class selection, size limits, snapshot support?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backup and restore capabilities - automated backups, point-in-time recovery, manual backup triggers?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: monitoring and observability - metrics exposure, logging integration, alerting?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: upgrade paths for MariaDB versions - in-place upgrades, blue-green deployment, version pinning?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST manage [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: network access and service exposure - cluster-internal only, load balancers, ingress, service mesh integration?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: resource limits and quotas - CPU/memory requests and limits, quality of service classes?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: configuration management - ConfigMaps, Secrets, custom MariaDB configurations, configuration validation?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scaling behaviors - vertical scaling, horizontal scaling through read replicas, automatic vs manual scaling?]
- **FR-019**: System MUST implement [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: security requirements - TLS/SSL encryption, secrets management, pod security standards, network policies?]
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: multi-tenancy scenarios - namespace isolation, resource sharing policies, quota enforcement?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MariaDB Instance**: Represents a deployed MariaDB database with its configuration, version, resource allocation, storage, and connectivity settings. Each instance maintains its own state and lifecycle.
- **Operator Configuration**: Represents operator-level settings that control behavior across all managed MariaDB instances, including default image registry, update strategies, and monitoring settings.
- **Backup**: Represents a point-in-time snapshot of MariaDB instance data, including metadata about backup time, size, retention policy, and restoration capabilities.
- **Replica**: Represents a secondary database instance that maintains a synchronized copy of data from a primary MariaDB instance for high availability or read scaling purposes.
